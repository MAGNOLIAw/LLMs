       "\"Give me 5 examples of cool potions and explain what they do.\\n\\nSure, here are five examples of cool potions that you might find in a fantasy story:\\n\\n1. The Elixir of Eternal Youth: This potion grants the drinker eternal youth, keeping them looking and feeling like they did in their prime for as long as they live. However, it also comes with a catch - the drinker must consume the elixir every year on their birthday, or else they will begin to age rapidly and lose all of the benefits of the potion.\\n2. The Potion of Healing: This potion can cure any wound or illness, no matter how severe. It works by drawing out the poison or injury from the drinker's body and replacing it with pure, healing energy. However, the potion can only be used once per day, and it leaves the drinker feeling drained and weak afterward.\\n3. The Draught of Dreams: This potion allows the drinker to enter into a deep, lucid dream state, where they can explore their subconscious mind and unlock hidden secrets about themselves and the world around them. However, the potion can be addictive, and long-term use can lead to a blurring of the lines between reality and dreams.\\n4. The Tincture of Transformation: This potion allows the drinker to transform into any creature or object they desire, giving them the ability to explore the world in new and exciting ways. However, the transformation is temporary, and the drinker must return to their original form within a set amount of time (usually an hour) or risk becoming trapped in their transformed state forever.\\n5. The Brew of Becoming: This potion allows the drinker to take on the abilities and memories of another person, effectively allowing them to become that person for a short period of time. However, the potion can only be used once per month, and long-term use can lead to a loss of personal identity and a blending of the drinker's own memories with those of the person they are imitating.\""

He got into his car\\nand backed out of number four’s drive.\\nIt was on the corner of the street that he noticed the ﬁrst sign\\nof something peculiar – a cat reading a map. For a second, Mr\\nDursley didn’t realise what he had seen – then he jerked his\\nhead around to look again. There was a tabby cat standing on\\nthe corner of Privet Drive, but there wasn’t a map in sight.\\nWhat could he have been thinking of? It must have been a\\ntrick of the light. Mr Dursley blinked and stared at the cat. It\\nstared back. As Mr Dursley drove around the corner and up the\\nroad, he watched the cat in his mirror. It was now reading the\\nsign that said Privet Drive – no, looking at the sign; cats\\ncouldn’t read maps or signs. Mr Dursley gave himself a little\\nshake and put the cat out of his mind. As he drove towards\\ntown he thought of nothing except a large order of drills he\\nwas hoping to get that day.\\nBut on the edge of town, drills were driven out of his mind\\nby something else. As he sat in the usual morning trafﬁc jam,\\nhe couldn’t help noticing that there seemed to be a lot of\\nstrangely dressed people about. People in cloaks. Mr Dursley\\ncouldn’t bear people who dressed in funny clothes – the get-\\nups you saw on young people! He supposed this was some\\nstupid new fashion. He drummed his ﬁngers on the steering\\nwheel and his eyes fell on a huddle of these weirdos standing\\nquite close by. They were whispering excitedly together. Mr\\nDursley was enraged to see that a couple of them weren’t\\nyoung at all; why, that man had to be older than he was, and\\nwearing an emerald-green cloak! The nerve of him! But then it\\nstruck Mr Dursley that this was probably some silly stunt –\\nthese people were obviously collecting for something … yes,\\nthat would be it.
